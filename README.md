This is Krishna Tyagi's 3rd year Mini Project.
This is a Blockchain based Certificate Generation and Validation System.
Once a Certificate has been generated it is stored in firebase and Ipfs server provided by Pinata Services.
And therefore anyone can view the certificates with their Certificate ID and then they can also be verified from the IPFS servers using the pdf_hash, and it also provides a pdf file to download of the certificate.
